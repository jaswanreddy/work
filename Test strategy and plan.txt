Test Strategy:Steps(ITDS)
-------------------------

1)Assess Testability:
---------------------
    1)operability:-4
    2)controllability:-5
    3)suitabilty:-5
    4)simplicity:-3
    5)undestandability:-5
    6)Stability:-5
    7)observability:-5
                        
                        

2)Test Factors: 
----------------
     1)Authorization:- Integration Testing
     2)Correctness:- Integration Testing
     3)Access control:- System testing
     4)Reliabilty:- uat
     5)Performance:- system testing
     6)Integrity:- system testing
     7)processing:-  post UAT


3)Assess drivers that would influence testing/approach:-
---------------------------------------------------------

      1)Authorization ---- Integration testing --- tester(Quality analyst)/validation/blackbox
      2)Correctness --- Integration testing --- tester/validation/blackbox/dynamic
      3)Access control --- system testing --- tester/verification/blackbox
      4)Reliabilty --- to what extent we trust --- uat(client/customer)
      5)performance --- system --- tester
      6)integrity --- system testing --- tester
      7)continuity of processing --- post UAT--- client



Test plan:
----------

   1)Test item:- Application name
   2)Software risk issues:- Security,performance
   3)Features to be tested(user stories):- Register users,manager and member function,Admin Funtions
   4)Features not to be tested:- new version(which is not a scope)
   5)Approach:- Whitebox,  blackbox(It contains code and UI)
   6)Test deliverables:- source code,Test scenario,test plan,test case,test execution report,test report,defect report
   7)Item pass/fail criteria:- If i find 5 minor bugs,1 major bug,with no critical/shoew stopper in this case (pass)
   8)Suspension&resumption criteria:- Show stooper in application/non-availabilty of resouce/when this is resolved
   9)Responsibility:- project manager,TEST LEAD,TESTER,CUSTOMER
  10)Staffing and testing needs:- Testing needs
  11)Schedule:- 2 weeks
